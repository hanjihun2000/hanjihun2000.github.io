Hello! I'm Jihun (Jay). I'm a final year undergraduate at the [Chinese University of Hong Kong](https://www.cuhk.edu.hk/english/index.html) majoring in Computer Science. My academic passion lies in Distributed Systems, Networks & Security, and Iâ€™m eager to apply my knowledge in these areas.

I'm currently interning at [Manulife (Manulife Investment Management)](https://www.manulifeim.com.hk/) as a full-stack developer in the Global Wealth & Asset Management Asia Technology Team.

Outside of academics, I enjoy exercising (especially running), reading business news, and travelling around the world.

Thank you for visiting my website. I look forward to sharing more about my journey!
